# Phase57-4 Long-session pacing audit

Date: 2026-10-04

## Purpose

Measure long-session repetition and interaction density before adding more systems.

The soak report now records:

- average authoritative actions per simulated week
- maximum actions required in one week
- weeks requiring more than four actions
- resolved event count and number of event weeks
- completed match count and number of match weeks
- existing save-size measurements remain unchanged

## Why this matters

A long-running management game can become tiring even when individual features are good. The useful signal is not only total content count, but how often the player is forced through repeated interactions before reaching the next meaningful week.

Phase57-4 keeps this as diagnostic output only. No new save state is persisted.

## Follow-up thresholds

Use 10-season and 30-season runs to identify:

- excessive action density
- event saturation
- match congestion
- save growth
- repeated low-value interactions

Any gameplay simplification should be justified by these measurements rather than adding another permanent screen.
